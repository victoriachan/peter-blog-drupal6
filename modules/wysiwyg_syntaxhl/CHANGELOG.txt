by meecect: Have not been able to fix ie collapsing whitespace issue, 
  so now, it will always writes <pre> tags into the page for IE, and other browsers
  will convert <pre> tags into {}-macro tags.  Either style will be read into the 
  editor fine though.
  
by meecect: added test for inline popups plugin, and modified routine to get proper
  languages regardless of standard popup or inline popup

by meecect: changed dialog.htm to dialog.php to add a dynamic script tag that can 
  determine the location of tiny_mce_popup.js.
  
by meecect: changed conversion routine to produce macro to use outerHTML to try and fix ie whitespace issue.
  so far I am unsuccessful.
  
by meecect: added a sample.html file that has some instructions and several
  cases of <pre>'s and {} to help testing various scenarios.
  
by meecect: removed any calls to innerHTML in dialog.js, in favor of a DOM
  technique in a custom function _getText.
  
by meecect: fixed loop counter that was causing plugin to only read brush
  class, and then breaking.
  
by meecect: reverted inclusion of tiny_mce_popup.js to static file to fix 
  safari issue.

by meecect: made it possible to edit older syntaxhl blocks and even regular
  pre's.

by meecect: changed method for converting pre blocks to macro using dom nodes.

by meecect: removed the syntaxhl comment that i was appending to pre blocks as
  unnecessary.

  that tiny insists on.
