SyntaxHL is a plugin for the Tinymce (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) javascript WYSIWYG editor 
allowing you to insert highlighted code into the editor.
The syntax highlighting is done using Syntax Highligher 
(http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) 
and the plugin simply produces the right syntax for this.

Changes: 

-Code was added to switch between the <pre> form to the {} form
of syntaxhighlighter, otherwise, the HTML that is generated has illegal class names
that conflict with some content filters.

-Code was added to dialog.htm to dynamically discover the tinyMCE popup javascript library using drupal
helper properties

-Code was added to dialog.htm to dynamically determine the proper language choices based on the Drupal
syntaxhighlighter module settings.
