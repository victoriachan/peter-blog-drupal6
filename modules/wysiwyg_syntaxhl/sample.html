# this block was already syntax highlighted in 'pre' format
# so it doesn't get the wysiwyg-syntaxhl special class.  If you save
# the node without invoking the popup, it will remain intact.
# If you edit it with the popup, it will then get the wysiwyg-syntaxhl class.  
# When saved, all pre's that have the wysiwyg-syntaxhl class are converted to 
# the macro format with {}'s
# Note: you can edit this text in the tinyMCE editor and not trigger
# the conversion, it will only get converted to the {} format if you click the syntax button and 
# invoke the popup

Just a regular pre block:

</p><pre>some
text                         with            white
space</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you enable the 'path' option in the wysiwyg profile section, you
can investigate the preceding pre boxes easily.&nbsp; Just put your cursor
in the box you want to check and look at the path.&nbsp; You should see
something like:</p><p>Path: pre.wysiwyg-syntaxhl brush: php;fontsize: 100; first-line: 1;</p><p>-for pre's that were created by converting macro {} to pre boxes, or for newly inserted syntax boxes from the popup.</p><p>&nbsp;or</p><p>Path: pre.brush: bash;fontsize: 100; first-line: 1;</p><p>-for syntax boxes that pre-existed in the node, and still use the pre format instead of the macro {} tags</p><p>or</p><p>Path: pre</p><p>-for regular pre tags that might pre-exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The syntax highlight button should 'activate' (button should get a border) if you place the cursor in ANY pre element.&nbsp; I am only checking for whether the element is a &lt;pre&gt;, that's it.</p>
